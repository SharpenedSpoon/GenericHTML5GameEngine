# Generic HTML5 Game Engine

## What is this?
I wanted to learn about the `canvas` element and how it works and how to use it, and also I have found all the existing javascript frameworks out there to be a bit too involved/complex for my tastes.

Not that all, or any, of them are bad - don't get me wrong! But if I am going to put in effort to learn a preexisting game engine and get better at it, then at the moment my efforts on that front are focused on growing within Unity3d.

## Can I run it?
Well, sure, I suppose if you'd really like to you may. I compile everything with Codekit 2, which gives autoprefixer support as well as combining Coffeescript files. This is nice as I can keep a bunch of separate Coffeescript files, but also not have to worry about function scoping or global variables!

You probably don't want to run it though. There might some interesting code here, or some snippets that will come in handy for someone, somewhere, at some point!

## What's the structure of your files?
Should be nice and self explanatory for the most part. I try to name things so they are obvious. I do separate files into an engine folder and an example games folder. The games I write with this will definitely dictate how the engine progresses.
